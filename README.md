# Futbin Player Market Crawler

Automated price tracker for Futbin.com with Google Sheets integration.

## 🎯 Key Features

✅ **Google Sheets V2** - Manage players directly in spreadsheet  
✅ **Auto-sync** - Updates every 30 seconds  
✅ **Smart dropdowns** - Auto-updates validation lists  
✅ **Multi-player** - Track unlimited players  
✅ **Anti-bot bypass** - Uses undetected-chromedriver

## What It Extracts

- **Cheapest Sale** - Lowest listed price
- **Average BIN** - Buy It Now average
- **EA Average** - EA's calculated price
- **Player Metadata** - Card type (Gold, Rare, Promo, etc.), rarity, overall rating and position

## Installation

1. Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/futbin-crawler
cd futbin-crawler
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Make sure you have Chrome browser installed (required for Selenium)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Google Sheets Integration (Recommended)

1. **Setup Google Cloud** - Follow setup in [GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md)
2. **Run V2 Connector**:
```bash
python google_sheets_connector_v2.py YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID
```
3. **Manage players** directly in Google Sheets "Players" tab

### Alternative: JSON Configuration

```bash
# Manage players locally
python manage_players.py

# Quickly add a player by name (URL auto-detected)
python manage_players.py add "Kylian Mbappé"

# Import batches of players directly from Futbin listings (page range optional)
python manage_players.py import_all 1 10 500

# Run crawler with JSON config
python crawler_with_config.py
```

The optional arguments represent `START_PAGE`, `END_PAGE` and `MAX` players to import, so the
example above will crawl Futbin pages 1 through 10 and stop after registering 500 new players. If
you omit the last parameters the importer continues until Futbin stops returning results.

## Future Integration

This crawler is designed to be easily integrated with:
- Google Sheets (via Google Sheets API)
- Excel files (via openpyxl or pandas)
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- REST APIs
- Automated monitoring systems

### Example: Save to CSV

```python
import csv
from futbin_crawler import FutbinCrawler

crawler = FutbinCrawler()
urls = [
    "https://www.futbin.com/26/player/257/melchie-dumornay/market",
    # Add more URLs
]

with open('player_prices.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=['url', 'cheapest_sale', 'actual_price', 'average_price'])
    writer.writeheader()
    
    for url in urls:
        result = crawler.extract(url)
        if result['success']:
            writer.writerow({
                'url': url,
                **result['data']
            })

crawler.close()
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Chrome/Chromedriver Issues**: The crawler uses `webdriver-manager` to automatically handle Chrome driver installation.

2. **Data Not Found**: Futbin may change their HTML structure. The crawler includes multiple extraction methods as fallbacks.

3. **Rate Limiting**: If making multiple requests, add delays between them to avoid being blocked:
```python
import time
time.sleep(2)  # Wait 2 seconds between requests
```

## Notes

- The crawler respects website structure and includes proper headers
- For production use, consider implementing rate limiting and caching
- Always check Futbin's terms of service and robots.txt
